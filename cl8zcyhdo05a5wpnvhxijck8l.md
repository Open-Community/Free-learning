# How I earned my postman Student Expert Badge


### About Postman

In today's world we are totally dependent on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), weather we want to book a cab or shop for something online, every task happens via APIs as it helps the client-side application (such as websites, mobile apps, etc.) to interact with the server and postman is a tool (one of the best) which is used to test an API. We can send requests, write tests and even add scripts in postman to test the behavior of an API.

I faced some difficulties (like- but honestly, I got stuck at one test as ```
